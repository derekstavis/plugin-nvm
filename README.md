## Install

```fish
$ omf install nvm
```
**NB** You have to install **nvm** itself separately (the [curl method](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#install-script) works fine under Fish too).


## Usage

```fish
$ nvm --help
```

If you have a custom `$NVM_DIR`, please add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, replacing the path accordingly:

```fish
set -gx NVM_DIR /path/to/nvm
```

Refresh your shell and you are good to go!

```fish
refresh
```

If you have installed nvm using a package manager you need to specify where is been installed, add the following line to  your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

```fish
set -g nvm_prefix /path/to/nvm
```
In this case, you don't need to set the `NVM_DIR` where the node versions will be installed, by default will be `~/.nvm`, but you can customize it if you want.

**Note** [Brew](https://brew.sh/) users don't have set up it, the plugin auto-detects it and set up the variable accordingly.
